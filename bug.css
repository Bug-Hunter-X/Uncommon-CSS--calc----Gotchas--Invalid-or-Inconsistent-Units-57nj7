The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, if the calculation results in a value that is not valid for the property being set, unexpected behavior can result. For instance, setting the `width` property to `calc(100% - 200px)` on an element within a container that is less than 200px wide will result in a negative width, which will typically be rendered as 0.  This can lead to unexpected layout issues or elements disappearing completely. Another less obvious problem occurs when combining units inconsistently, for instance `calc(100% + 1em)` might not produce the expected result across different fonts or screen sizes.
